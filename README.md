# sorting-methods
This code is intended to help understand and compare sorting algorithms. For educational purposes only, don't use this if you care about performance.
This repository provides:
 - Methods for sorting an array of numbers (Counting sort in ''counting_sort.py'', and Merge sort in ''merge_sort.py''). 
 - Unit tests to check that the sorting methods work for a variety of cases (in ''tests/'').
 - Runtime tests to measure and compare the computational complexity of each sorting algorithm (in ''runtime_tests.py'').
